### Usage

You need to have moviepy package installed:  
pip install moviepy  

You can either put the file in the same directory as main.py or use full or relative path:  

video_path = "/full/path/to/your/video/file.mp4"  
or  
video_path = "relative/path/to/your/video/file.mp4"  

Same goes for the output_path.  

When you're ready just run main.py
