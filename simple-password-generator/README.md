#### Description

This little script will generate a complex password of given length<br>
with a random mix of numbers, capital and lowercase letters and special symbols.<br>
If you chose to save the password it will create a file called "passwords.txt"<br>
in the same directory where the script is located. Make sure to secure it.<br>
And ofcourse you can modify it any way that suits your needs.
