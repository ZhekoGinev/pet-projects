## Description

This little script will generate a complex password of given length<br>
with a random mix of numbers, capital and lowercase letters and special symbols.<br>
If you choose to save the password it will create a file called "passwords.txt"<br>
in the same directory where the script is located. Make sure it's a secure location.<br>
And ofcourse you can modify it any way that suits your needs.<br><br>
__It goes without saying the passwords.txt file must be closed when the script is ran.__

#### Below is a simple snippet of the script in action<br>
